### Work Experience

**Ant Technologies & Services** 08/2019 - now

*Web Developer*

Work on a small development team, with less than a dozen developers. That means I've touched every part of the development chain: from end to end. However, it is still an outsourcing company, mainly developing CMS products and tools, ERP, Internal CRM ... as well as APIs for other areas, such as Mobile and Game Gateway.
In the vast majority of 2019, I mostly worked in back-end development with Java | Spring Boot 2 | Express.

As 2020 comes, I move to full-time front-end development and become the only front-end developer on the team.
