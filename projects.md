1. [Cooked](https://github.com/bodetaima/cooked): A small and efficient CLI tool to generate Node project templates, including React, Vue with Webpack boilerplates, Express,...[NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cooked).
2. [Concept.io](https://github.com/bodetaima/concept.io): A side project that clone the concept of [Notion.so](https://notion.so) but with my point of view and implements. Build with MERN stack and containerize with Docker & docker-compose.
3. [react-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/bodetaima/react-webpack-boilerplate): The boilerplate of React with my Webpack configuration to fit with various range of production. Inherit to Cooked as a template.
4. [vue-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/bodetaima/vue-webpack-boilerplate): The boilerplate of Vue with Webpack configuration to fit with various range of production. Inherit to Cooked as a template.

Many more but too shame to show. And many more to come in the near future.
